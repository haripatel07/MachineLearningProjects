# Handwritten Digits Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of digits (0-9). A machine learning model is trained to recognize these digits with high accuracy.

## Features
- Uses the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit recognition.
- Implements a **binary classifier** for distinguishing a selected digit.
- Trains and evaluates a machine learning model.
- Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) for understanding the dataset.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is loaded using Scikit-Learn's built-in datasets module. It consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project step by step:
```bash
jupyter notebook Updated_HandwrittenDigitsClassification.ipynb
```

## Results
- The model successfully classifies handwritten digits with high accuracy.
- Future improvements can include using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better performance.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **deep learning approach** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or FastAPI.
