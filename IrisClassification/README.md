# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**. The dataset used is the well-known **Iris Dataset**, which consists of 150 samples with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Goals
- Understand fundamental ML concepts through **Iris classification**.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize feature distributions.
- Implement a **classification model** and evaluate its performance.
- Document the process for learning and future reference.

## Dataset
The dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module and contains:
- **150 samples** (50 per species)
- **Four features** (Sepal/Petal Length & Width)
- **Three classes** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Implementation Details
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features.
- **EDA**: Used Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.
- **Model Selection**: Compared multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Notebook Documentation**: Step-by-step implementation with markdown explanations.

## Results
- Achieved **high classification accuracy (~95-98%)**.
- Visualized decision boundaries of models.
- Compared performance metrics across classifiers.
